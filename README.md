> **"In the 4 minutes and 11 seconds following a jackpot, Hakari is effectively immortal."**

Turn your coding sessions into a high-stakes gamble. When you hit the jackpot, your workspace transforms into a legendary "Fever" state featuring **Tuka Donka** and Hakari’s iconic dance.

> [!WARNING]
> **Photosensitivity Warning:** This extension features fast-flashing colors and "Party Mode" visual effects. Use with caution if you are sensitive to flashing lights.
> 
> **Intentional Design:** In accordance with the lore, the jackpot **cannot be stopped** once it has begun until the 4:11 timer expires. Closing the sidebar or reloading the window are your only means of early termination.

*   **Visual Slot Machine:** Interactive sidebar UI with smooth reel animations and a physical pull-handle experience.
