# 🎰 VS Code: Idle Death Gamble (Hakari Dance)

Turn your coding sessions into a high-stakes gamble. When you hit the jackpot, the editor transforms into a 4-minute and 11-second "fever" state featuring **Tuka Donka** and Hakari’s legendary dance.

## ⚡ Features

*   **The Jackpot System:** Every time you pass a test or click the gamble button, there is a chance to hit the Jackpot.
*   **Fever Mode:** On a successful roll, the "Tuka Donka" Phonk track plays for exactly 4 minutes and 11 seconds (Hakari's infinite cursed energy duration).
*   **Visual Hype:** A configurable GIF of Hakari dancing appears in the corner of your editor during Fever Mode.
*   **Live Timer:** A pulsing gold timer counts down the invincibility period.
*   **Slot Machine SFX:** Authentic rolling sounds while the extension "calculates" your luck.

## ⚙️ Configuration

You can customize the gamble in your `settings.json`:

*   `hakari.jackpotChance`: Probability of winning (default: `0.8` / 80%).
*   `hakari.gifPosition`: Choose where the dancer appears (`Beside` [default] or `CurrentColumn`).
*   `hakari.triggerOnTestSuccess`: Automatically roll the slots when your integrated test runner passes.
