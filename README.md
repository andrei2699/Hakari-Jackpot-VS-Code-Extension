# 🎰 VS Code: Idle Death Gamble (Hakari Dance)

Turn your coding sessions into a high-stakes gamble. When you hit the jackpot, the editor transforms into a 4-minute and 11-second "fever" state featuring **Tuka Donka** and Hakari’s legendary dance.

## ⚡ Features

* **The Jackpot System:** Every time you pass a test or click the gamble button, there is a chance to hit the Jackpot.
* **Fever Mode:** On a successful roll, the "Tuka Donka" Phonk track plays for exactly 4 minutes and 11 seconds (Hakari's infinite cursed energy duration).
* **Visual Hype:** A configurable GIF of Hakari dancing appears in the corner of your editor during Fever Mode.
* **Slot Machine SFX:** Authentic rolling sounds while the extension "calculates" your luck.

## ⚙️ Configuration

You can customize the gamble in your `settings.json`:

* `hakari.jackpotChance`: Probability of winning (default: `0.8` / 80%).
* `hakari.gifPosition`: Choose where the dancer appears (Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right, etc.).
* `hakari.triggerOnTestSuccess`: Automatically roll the slots when your integrated test runner passes.

## 📂 Assets (TODO)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **TODO:** Add the following assets to the `/assets` folder:
> * `tuka_donka.mp3` (4:11 duration)
> * `hakari_dance.gif` (Transparent background recommended)
> * `slot_roll.wav` (Sfx for the gambling phase)
> * `jackpot_start.wav` (Sfx for the moment the jackpot hits)
