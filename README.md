# 🎰 VS Code: Idle Death Gamble (Hakari Dance)

Turn your coding sessions into a high-stakes gamble. When you hit the jackpot, the editor transforms into a 4-minute and 11-second "fever" state featuring **Tuka Donka** and Hakari’s legendary dance.

> [!WARNING]
> **Photosensitivity Warning:** This extension features fast-flashing colors and "Party Mode" visual effects during the Jackpot Fever. Please use with caution if you are sensitive to flashing lights.

## ⚡ Features

*   **The Jackpot System:** Every time you pass a test or click the gamble button, there is a chance to hit the Jackpot.
*   **Fever Mode:** On a successful roll, the "Tuka Donka" Phonk track plays for exactly 4 minutes and 11 seconds.
*   **Party Mode Visuals:** During Fever Mode, the sidebar comes alive with **flashing background colors**, sparkles, and Hakari dancing to the beat.
*   **Live Timer:** A pulsing gold timer counts down the invincibility period.
*   **Slot Machine SFX:** Authentic rolling sounds while the extension "calculates" your luck.
